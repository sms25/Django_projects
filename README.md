## 1. Housing Price Prediction System
The system is trained from the California housing prices data (1990 US Census). It takes the longitude, latitude, housing median age, total number of rooms, total number of bedrooms, population, households and median income values as input and predicts the median house value accordingly. For the prediction model, the Random Forest Regression supervised learning algorithm is used. It is available here: https://github.com/sms25/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Housing_Price_Prediction_ML.ipynb<br>
